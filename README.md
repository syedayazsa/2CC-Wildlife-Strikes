# 2CC-Wildlife-Strikes
A wildlife strike is a collision between an animal (most often a bird, but sometimes another species) and a manmade vehicle, especially aircraft. Wildlife strikes constitute a serious hazard to aircraft safety and have caused a number of fatal accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority counted 177,269 wildlife strike reports on civil aircraft between 1990 and 2015, growing 38% in seven years from 2009 to 2015. Birds accounted for 97% 

## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
